# High-Dimensional-Data-Analysis: Wine-Dataset

## About This Repo

High Dimensional in statistics refers to how many attributes a dataset has.
With high dimensional data, the number of features can exceed the number of observations.
Reduction of dimensionality means to simplify understanding of data, either numerically or visually. Data could be combined into groups, scaled, classified, grouped.

## Wine Dataset
This dataset was adapted from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data

## The Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

Jupyter Notebook for Python 3 was used to perform analysis.
